# REQUIRED

On your localhost, set a cookie with the name PHPSESSID, the same as when requesting /Api/Basket. To do this, you do not need to be logged in on the site itself. PHPSESSID is required for correct identification of FUser ID (id of the product cart holder)

# bitrix-basket

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.


## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
